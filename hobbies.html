<h1>Trip 2019-2020</h1>
<h4> Ireland </h4>
<p> In Ireland we rented a car and travelled around the country. We went on several hikes, including the Giants Causeway in Northern Ireland. The hike had gorgeous coastal views that ended at the causeway. Although the actual Giants Causeway was very touristy, there were few tourists on the actual trail. Getting to the town where the trail starts was interesting. We missed our train ... </p>

<h4> Croatia </h4>
<p> We ended up in Croatia more by chance rather pure intention. However, it was one of our favourite places that we visited. The beaches are accessible right from the town and the coffee was amazing. We were going to attempt a hike up the mountain outside the town, however, we reconsidered once we read the trail head that said you needed to leave your information with emergency... </p>

<h4> Greece </h4>
<p> The ruins in greece were beautiful. Athens was not what we were anticipating. The city is dense with ruins randomly dispersed throughout. The crowds are constant. There was a nice little christmas themed cafe though. An old lady tried to put a curse on me after I refused a rose... </p>

<h4> Chezkia </h4>
<p> This little town was absolutely stunning! Everything about the town made it seem like it was straight out of a story book. Cobblestone roads, canals, tiny bridges, no chain restaurants ... </p>

<h4> Austria </h4>
<p> This is one of the largest hikes we did. We took the cart up and hiked our way down. There were stunning views of mountains and lakes the entire decent. Some of the best hikes we did were in Austria. Would highly recommend. </p>
