<h1>Hello! I'm Meghan Noonan</h1>
<p class= "paragraphboxmain"> My education began at the University of Guelph, where, like many who attend Guelph, I was under the impression I wanted to be a vet. That dream was quickly replaced by a new one after travelling to Thailand and volunteering at a wildlife rehabilitation sanctuary. It was there that I discovered my passion for conservation and research. Upon this discovery, I switched my degree to wildlife biology and conservation and started down the path towards a career in conservation. After graduating, I completed an MSc position in Newfoundland where my research focused on modelling forest restoration trajectories after herbivore overbrowsing. </p>
<p class= "paragraphboxmain"> Since completing my post-graduate studies, I have been looking for a position that would allow me to make significant contributions to conservation efforts while expanding on my existing ecological skill set. Through this pursuit, I was able to work with several fantastic companies that led me to my most recent pursuit, studying GIS at Fleming College. It is my hope that once I complete my program I will be able to combine my conservation, modelling and GIS skills and work with a company that helps conserve and restore our ecosystems. </p>
